This repository contains Verilog codes, including both RTL designs and related modules.
If anyone has any doubts about the code, finds any errors, or needs any specific Verilog code, feel free to email me at "arjunpshetty.0@gmail.com".

 note : This folder contains the complete project from AMD Vivado. Some folders include files written in languages other than Verilog, as they are part of the project structure. Please clone the entire folder and open the project in Vivado without making any modifications.
